                Hello, my name is Luke Warrior and welcome to my new blog. This is more of a project to add further content to my website and further solidify my knowledge as opposed to being something people will actually read but you never know 
                I might end up enjoying writing my thoughts down for other people to read. I have a few passions which i enjoy including cycling, web development, gaming and coffee (dont ask).
            </p>
            <p>
                Given this is more of a test than an actual post I will leave this here and this will be my template for future posts (assuming there are any).
                Thanks for reading Paul, likely the only person who will ever see this.
